### Creating Snapshots

The first effective thing to know while learning git is, how to take a snapshot of your project

- **Initializing a repo**

  - First to initialize a git repo, we have to create a directory in our system and we have to change current directory to newly created one

  ```bash
  mkdir learn-git
  cd mkdir
  ```

  - Next is to initialize a git repository in current path (learn-git) in our example. The below command will initialize a empty repository in (learn-git) folder

  ```bash
  git init
  ```
